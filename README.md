Image of meat dataset such as: Pig, Cow, and Horse

We extract the feature of these images using GLCM function
GLCM functions characterize the texture of an image by calculating how often pairs of pixel with specific values and in a specified spatial relationship occur in an image, creating a GLCM, and then extracting statistical measures from this matrix

After extracting the feature, we can classify the dataset using KNN and Naive Bayes classification
